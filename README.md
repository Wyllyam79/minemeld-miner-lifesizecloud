# minemeld-miner-lifesizecloud
MineMeld Miner for Youtube channels implemented as an extension

## How it works

This simple Miner periodically checks the LifeSize Community site page URL (https://community.lifesize.com/docs/DOC-2471-lifesize-server-and-tunnel-gateway-ip-address-list) for the IP addresses of the LifeSizeCloud servers.
